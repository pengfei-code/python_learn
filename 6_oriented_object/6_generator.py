#A generator  can  generator iterators from a set of items you want to add

#what is the diffrence between the method of generator and the normal method
#w =fibonacci() will not  execute the content of method untill the method of next or
#method of send

#and if you call the next() method then the system will execute the method of fibonacci
#and it will be stoped in the phrase of "yield c" ,and if you traverse all over the
#iters and then it will jump out the "yield c",then it will execute the last phrase of
#print("after yield")
